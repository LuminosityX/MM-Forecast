## Framework

![model](figs/framework.png)

## Requirements 
For details, check the [mm_forecsat.yaml](https://github.com/LuminosityX/MM-Forecast/mm_forecsat.yaml) file. You can complete the configuration of the environment with the following command: 
```bash
conda env create -f mm_forecast.yaml
```

## Dataset
The datasets of forecastig are in the folder 'datasets_forecasting'. Place the data in the root or other directory.
Data structure:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ datasets_forecasting/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ text/
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ event/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ all_dataset.csv                       
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ final_test.csv                          (events in the test set)

## Temporal Event Forecasting
Code file structure:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ code_forecasting/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ text/
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ ICL/              (related events are from 'Nearest_events_summary', 'Further_events_summary', and 'Related_facts_summary' in the dataset)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ object/         (candidate set is the 'Candidates' in the dataset)
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ text_only.py
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ w_image.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ relation/       (candidate set is the 'Candidates_relation ' in the dataset)
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ text_only.py
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ w_image.py
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ RAG/              (related events are retrieved.)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ object/         (candidate set is the 'Candidates' in the dataset)
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ text_only.py
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ w_image.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ relation/       (candidate set is the 'Candidates_relation ' in the dataset)
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ text_only.py
â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ w_image.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ graph/
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ ICL/              (related events are from 'Nearest_events_object/relation', 'Further_events_object/relation', and 'Related_Facts_object/relation' in the dataset)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ RAG/              (related events are retrieved.)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```
We refer to the root path as '$ROOT_PATH$', and the file you want to run as '$FILE_EF$'. You can run the following code for temporal event forecsating:
'''python
python '$FILE_EF$' root_path='$ROOT_PATH$'
'''
